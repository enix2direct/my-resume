    <h2>Career Acomplishments</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using Ignition Automation, built an automated maintenance PM (Preventive Maintenance) 
                screen using PLC tags in Allen Bradley's RS Logix 5000, enabling accurate measurement
                of machine uptime for critical parts. Implemented a public-facing HMI using Ignition's
                Vision client to display real-time data for all production lines, including critical
                part run times and estimated replacement dates.</li>
            <li>Designed and deployed an automated fluid injection system to eliminate human error,
                resulting in an 80% reduction in scrap production. Programmed ladder logic and integrated
                flow meters to regulate the flow of critical foam control fluid, preventing disruptions
                in the manufacturing process.</li>
            <li>Modernized and improved HMI screens to deliver relevant and accurate information to line
                personnel. Conducted audits of existing HMI control screens to optimize data display for
                better operator visibility and efficiency</li>
        </ul>
